Just a little game I made forever ago. I'm revamping it because my daughter enjoys playing it.

### Planned Changes

- Remove unused gamepd buttons
- ~~Prestige mechanics~~
- ~~Sammy powerups~~
- ~~Reduced honeycomb collection on death~~
- Reflection chance attribute
- ~~Bonus honeycomb on success criteria~~
- Double shot chance attrbute
- Cosmetic purchaces - do not reset on pretige
- Passkve honeycomb earnings. Buy a bee hive and collect from it every day. Adds potential options for duration and amount. 
- challenge mode prestige?
- Extra life shop purchase?
- Shielding attribute
    - Maximum damage reduction - Shield acts as damage reduction
    - Maximum shield amount - Shield has only so much life before it no longer works.
- ~~Distance calculation is not working.~~
- Levels 7, 8, and 9 might have hidden birds
- ~~Touching Sammy adds to max health making current health percentage drop~~
- Enough stingers cause the stingers to go in a vertical line instead of an arc
- Sammy time possibly slowing stingers?
